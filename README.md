A demo level plugin to show how to implement the [Phantom Token Pattern](https://curity.io/resources/learn/phantom-token-pattern/) via LUA.\
This enables a secure API solution for integrating with the open source version of the Kong API Gateway.

## Documentation

This repository is documented in the [Kong Open Source API Gateway Integration](https://curity.io/resources/learn/integration-kong-open-source/) article on the Curity Web Site.

## Credits

This repo used some Kong / LUA techniques from [Vasiliy Malyavin's solution](https://github.com/vmalyavin/kong-token-introspection).
We then adapted the code to fit with Curity's design recommendations for securing APIs.
